### Project management

#### Checklist for NEW ideas :baby:
Hey, you're official! You're now part of the growing Progressive HackNight community. Here's a few things to get started (a couple you've probably already done).

- [x] Create this idea issue
- [x] Flesh out the who, where, and what questions above
- [ ] Join our [Slack](https://progressivehacknight.slack.com)
- [ ] Join the [#project-leads](https://progressivehacknight.slack.com/messages/CFLCLB1PV/) channel. 
- [ ] Ping an organizer to get started (The organizer in charge of onboarding new projects will be listed in the channel topic)

#### Checklist for ACTIVE projects :fire:
Let's get this project started! When this idea starts taking off, the Progressive HackNight Team will start helping this project's lead(s) out with project management and connecting you to resources you may need. To get there, please complete and check off the following:

- [ ] Update your project at least once a month.  This can be either an update on this issue, a ping in the project-ideas channel, rsvp-ing to hacknight, or a conversation with one of the organizers managing project progress (the one listed in the channel topic). 
  - It's ok even if your update is just "nothing new happened this month" or "we saw a small increase in traffic to our app this month". If nobody hears from you at all in more than one month, we may mark it as `abandoned` so that others can pick up this idea and run with it.
- [ ] Create a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/new) and Slack channel for work.
- [ ] [Create issues](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/project-set-up-for-collaboration-with-github/#assignment--add-your-first-issue) to describe each task that you plan to do or need help with and how a contributor can get started on that task. You might start and stop a lot, so consider issues as your to-do list.
- [ ] Create a [team](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-team/) for your core contributors
  - This will make it easier for you to manage your github repo access. People on a team have the same level of access. Admin access will allow your trusted contributors to make changes as needed. 
  - You can remove and add people to your team as needed. 
  - Note: You can also allow collaborators outside of your team and give them more limited access.
- [ ]   Create a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), or other cloud storage to share larger files
  - Github and Data.World are good for code and data, respectively, especially when you need version control. But they're not good for very large files, documentation, articles, etc. A cloud storage option will allow you to easily share, create, and collaborate on documents with your team and help organize ideas and thoughts.
  - Doing this early on can help your team stay organized and to onboard new contributors who wouldn't have access to files you all have shared over email.


If you get stuck at any point, feel free to reach out to the leadership team in the slack channel or with an email to organizers@progressivehacknight.org or come find an organizer at a HackNight. We're here to help bring great ideas to life!
